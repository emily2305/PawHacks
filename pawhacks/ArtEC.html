                <h3>Congressional Art Competition</h3>
                <p>
                    Artists are invited to use a variety of mediums for this national high school art competition, including painting, drawing, print, collage, mixed media, digital art, and photographs. Submit your work to your congressional representative’s office to be judged within your district. Winners will go on to have their art displayed for one year at the US Capitol.

                <p>
                    Students aged 15-18 apply for a spot at the National YoungArts Week, where they are mentored by top artists and compete for scholarships and a nomination as a US Presidential Scholar in the Arts. This award is granted to high schoolers who demonstrate excellence in both art and academics. This competition isn’t limited to visual arts, but also includes categories for writing, music, and dance.

                <p>
                    High school artists submit work to be judged at the regional level, with winners going on to the national competition. Winners can receive scholarships of up to $10,000, and will be recognized at a ceremony in NYC’s Carnegie Hall. Judging categories include everything from Video Games to Jewelry to Architecture & Industrial Design (as well as more traditional categories like Painting, Drawing & Illustration, and Photography).

            <h2><strong>National Art Society</strong></h2>
            <p>
                With chapters in high schools across the country, NAHS recognizes more than 58,000 students who demonstrate “an outstanding ability and interest in art.” Members can access leadership opportunities, scholarships, and more. Depending on a student’s level of participation in NAHS, it will largely be a tier 1-3 activity. For example, if a student wins a national award or scholarship through the society, it’s likely a tier 1 activity, while a chapter secretary should think of it as a tier 3 activity.
